  I decided to create “BLACK DREAM” because I was one of those kids that saw the “AMERICAN DREAM” as a way out. I grew up around a lot of poverty, drugs, and violence. I managed to get through it all in way, as a kid I began to wrestle competitively and by the time I finished high school I was a decorated athlete and was able to obtain a scholarship to compete on the collegiate level. It wasn’t easy I made many mistakes; my greatest gift in those years was my daughter. Having her slowed me down and made me refocus. In doing so I became the first person in my immediate family to acquire a college degree. At this time I thought I was on top of the world, I quote on quote made it! To my surprise I was wrong I continued to be optimistic but I also began to wake up. I realized that I didn’t fit into the “AMERICAN DREAM”; I started to ask myself what is the BLACK DREAM? What am I supposed to hope for or look forward to? The absence of a vocal leader in our community made me decide to commit myself to my community and work on providing members of the community with the necessary knowledge, tools, and leadership to excel in life. To obtain the BLACK DREAM we must LEAD, EDUCATE, CREATE, AND BUILD from within.
